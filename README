This is a new implementation of SMP Hardcore. If you die, you are banned.

Here are a few features:

Configurable ban time (default is one week)
Commands for admins to ban,unban and get info on dead players
Players are told what date and time they will be allowed back when they die and when they try to log back early.
The plugin logs every death along with level, exp, location and death message in csv format for easy exporting
Does not have the "dead players hog a login spot" issue.
Fully open source and supported on GitHub

Future features:
Final Farewell: Admins can choose to allow players to live for a short time and chat and say goodbye
Purgatory: Admins can choose an alternate respawn point for fallen players.
Sound and Fury: A non damaging lightning and thunderclap should go off each time a player dies. Because it would be cool.
Estate Sale: When the plugin is run along side security and property management plugins such as Residence, property will become free after a player dies. Optionally, the admins can turn on a setting that will announce a dead players home location to the entire server. Will the players rush in to loot items? Will there only be traps waiting? Will it be an ambush? Fun times.
HTML export: Rather than only csv exporting for the death log, maybe something more useful to post to a server home page.
Death maps: Easy tieins to mapping software that would allow for overlay of death logs
